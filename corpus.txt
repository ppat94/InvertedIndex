Here aux_program is at most one of java, php, python (your choice).

Once you have coded your program, I want you to come up with 10 paragraphs from Wikipedia pages of your choice.

These will be your corpus. Decide on two phrases your would like to search about involving at least three terms.
Decide by hand which documents you feel are relevant not relevant to your queries.
Consider formulating a search for each of these phrases using either a purely conjunctive query or a purely disjunctive query.

For each search phrase determine how your program would ranks results for the purely conjunctive
and purely disjunctive query variation and determine the top 5 documents returned for each of these cases.

Then by hand compute the precision@5 and recall@5 scores.
This homework consists of two parts a coding part and an experiment part.
The query is a sequence of command line arguments in Polish notation.
Each command line argument in the query is either _AND, _OR, or a term.
Here a term is defined to be an alphanumeric string not containing underscore.

For this homework, two terms are the same if they are the same after converting them to lower case.
An example of running the program might be:
To compute VSM scores use all the terms from the query. I.e., for the above these would be good, dog, bad, cat.
